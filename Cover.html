<H3><i>Experience Summary</H3>
<p>I applied to the Kroger Company in May of 2019, and I am still employed at Kroger. At Kroger, I developed communication skills working with customers and coworkers, technical skills working as a cashier and at self-checkout, and I developed a stronger work ethic while working at Kroger. Moreover, I have worked at EastLake Community Church as an intern/volunteer since February of 2017. I have learned how to work with varieties of technical equipment, such as camera, sound, video, and lighting.</p> 

<H3>My Perceived Calling</H3>
<p>I feel a strong inclination that God is calling me to the field of Computer Science. I perceive this as my calling for a few different reasons. First, ever since I was very young, I have always possessed a very strong passion and appreciation for technology. Today, I can work on any kind of technical equipment for numerous hours and not become distracted or weary. Moreover, I consider technology to be extremely fun and entertaining and one of my favorite hobbies. Also, I consider math and science to be my favorite subjects in school, which correlate with fields of engineering. Finally, God has graciously gifted me with considerable skillsets and talents in the field of technology. </p>
