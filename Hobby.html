<H3>Soccer<H/H3>
<p>I have and always will consider soccer the best sport in the world. I love the teamwork aspect of soccer, for it takes all the players working in unison for the team to be truly effective. It only takes one player to make a mistake and the entire team can become compromised. When the offense and the defense work as one, the team becomes remarkably more powerful.</p>

<H3>Technology<H/H3>
<p>I have always had a strong passion for technology. It excites me to learn more about technology. Also, I am humbled by the complexity of the technology that God uniquely designed in this earth. Since God has gifted me with ablities in technology, I can give Him the glory that He rightfully deserves by being a light to others through this amazing vast field of creation.</p>

<H3>Hiking/Camping<H/H3>
<p>Ever since I joined the Boy Scouts, I became interested in hiking and camping. It is a great time to connect with others while admiring God's beautiful creation. Furthermore, if one ventures alone, they can have an amazing and quiet experience while seeking God in the great outdoors.</p>

<H3>Water Sports<H/H3>
<p>As a result of having a house on Smith Mountain Lake, I have come to love swimming, boating, kayaking, water tubing, jet skiing, and water- skiing. Some of the greatest memories in my life come from spending time with friends and family on the lake. I will never forget water tubing with family and friends such as Taylor, Tyler, Evan, Michael, and many more. Also, I greatly appreciate boating with my mom and dad on the lake while having an amazing time. </p>
